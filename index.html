   <h2 class="titles" >Visualizing Musical Expression</h2>

   <p> Welcome to this interactive visualization of two experiments in perceived 
  musical expression that were performed in the context for the 
  <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/research/projects/con-espressione/">
  <em>Con Espressione</em> project </a>!
  </p>
  
  <p>In the 
  <a href="http://con-espressione.cp.jku.at/">
   first experiment </a>
  listeners were asked to describe, in free text (preferable adjectives), the
  perceived expressive character of different performances of several Baroque, 
  Classical, and Romantic solo piano pieces.

    In the second experiment, two groups of music experts were asked to sort the 
    150 most common descriptors of the first experiment into "piles" of similar terms.
  </p>

   <p>This visualization reveals some of the results of these experiments.
    In the right column you see the performances used in the first experiment.
    In the center you see a two-dimensional representation of the 150 most important terms, created using Multidimensional Scaling.
    In the left column you see two lists of piles as created and named by
    the two groups of experts, representing two alternative ways of
    structuring this space of musical characterizations.
    There are three ways to interact with this visualization: <br>
    <br>
    (1) Click on a performance to see the terms used by listeners to describe this performance.
    Every term is in turn connected to the two piles it was sorted into.<br>
    (2) Click on a pile to see only the terms that were sorted into it.
    Every term is in turn connected to all the performance it was used for.<br>
    (3) Click on a term to see both piles it was sorted into as well as all performances it was used for.
    All terms that were were sorted into the same two piles are connected too.
  
  </p>

   <p>
    For more details on the experiments and the creation and analysis of this data, please see the publications below.
    The datasets (including many modalities not used in this visualization) are available for further research too.
