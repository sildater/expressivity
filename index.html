   <h2 class="titles" >Visualizing Musical Expression</h2>
   <p> Welcome to this interactive visualization of two experiments in preceived musical expression that were performed
    in the context of the <em>Con Espressione</em> project!
   </p>
   <p>In the first experiment listeners were asked to describe the expressive performance of several pieces of Baroque, Classical, or Romatnic solo piano in free text.
    In the second experiment, two groups of music experts were asked to sort the 150 most common descriptors of the first experiment into "piles" of similar terms.
 </p>
   <p>This visualization shows a part the results of these experiments.
    In the right column you see the performances used in the first experiment.
    In the center you see a two-dimensional representation of the 150 most important terms, created using Multidimensional Scaling.
    In the left column you see two lists of piles as created and named by the two groups of experts.
    There are three ways to interact with this visualization: <br>
    <br>
    (1) Click on a performance to see the terms used by listeners to describe this performance.
    Every term is in turn connected to the two piles it was sorted into.<br>
    (2) Click on a pile to see only the terms that were sorted into it.
    Every term is in turn connected to all the performance it was used for.<br>
    (3) Click on a term to see both piles it was sorted into as well as all performances it was used for.
    All terms that were were sorted into the same two piles are connected too.
  
  </p>
   <p>
    For more details on the experiments and the creation and analysis of this data, please see the publications below.
    The datasets (including many modalities not used in this visualization) are available for further research too.
