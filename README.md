# Visualizing Musical Expression

This repository contains the code for an interactive visualization of two experiments in perceived musical expression that were performed in the context for the 
 [*Con Espressione* project](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/research/projects/con-espressione/). 
 
 You can find the visualization [here](https://cpjku.github.io/expressivity)!
